\title{Filter RR Intervals by Physiological Plausibility}
\usage{
filter_physiological_rr(rr_intervals, min_rr = 272, max_rr = 2000)
}
\arguments{
\item{rr_intervals}{Numeric vector of RR intervals in milliseconds}

\item{min_rr}{Minimum physiologically plausible RR interval in milliseconds.
Default is 272 ms (equivalent to ~220 bpm)}

\item{max_rr}{Maximum physiologically plausible RR interval in milliseconds.
Default is 2000 ms (equivalent to ~30 bpm)}
}
\value{
A logical vector of the same length as \code{rr_intervals}, where \code{TRUE}
indicates the RR interval is within physiological bounds
}
\description{
Filters RR intervals to remove physiologically implausible values based on
minimum and maximum thresholds. This is typically the first step in RR
interval preprocessing.
}
\details{
This function applies basic physiological constraints to RR intervals:
\itemize{
\item Values below \code{min_rr} are considered too fast (unrealistic heart rates)
\item Values above \code{max_rr} are considered too slow (unrealistic heart rates)
\item The default range corresponds to heart rates between 30-220 bpm
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
rr_data <- c(800, 850, 200, 900, 2500, 820)  # Some with artifacts
valid_mask <- filter_physiological_rr(rr_data)
clean_rr <- rr_data[valid_mask]
}
