\title{Detect and Classify Artefacts in Heart Rate Variability Time Series}
\usage{
classify_hrv_artefacts_lipponen(
  data,
  alpha = 5.2,
  c1 = 0.13,
  c2 = 0.17,
  qd_window = 91
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{dplyr::tibble} with at least one column:
\itemize{
\item \code{time}: A numeric vector representing RR intervals (time since the last
beat) in seconds.
}}

\item{alpha}{A numeric value representing the scaling factor for threshold
calculation.  Defaults to 5.2 as suggested in the paper.}

\item{c1}{Constant for ectopic beat detection boundary. Defaults to 0.13.}

\item{c2}{Constant for ectopic beat detection boundary. Defaults to 0.17.}

\item{qd_window}{Window size for quartile deviation calculation. Defaults to 91.}
}
\value{
A \code{dplyr::tibble} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{time}: The original RR intervals (in seconds).
\item \code{classification}: A character vector indicating the classification of each
RR interval.  (Same possible values as before)
}

\description{
This function implements the robust algorithm for heart rate variability (HRV)
time series artefact correction described in Lipponen & Tarvainen (2019).
It detects and classifies artefacts such as extra, missed, misaligned, and
ectopic beats in RR interval time series data.
}
\details{
The algorithm uses time-varying thresholds based on the distribution of
successive RR-interval differences (\code{dRRs}) and differences between
individual RR intervals and a median RR interval (\code{mRRs}).  It implements
a decision algorithm (see Figure 1 in the paper) to classify beats into
different artefact types.  Missing beats are handled specially:  a new row
is \emph{inserted} into the tibble, with the \code{time} value representing the estimated
time of the missed beat (half of the "long" interval), and the
\code{classification} set to \code{"missed"}. This insertion ensures that subsequent
calculations depending on the number of beats can be performed correctly.
Long, short and ectopic beat are not corrected in this function. The original
time series including all kind of original beats is returned.

\examples{
library(dplyr)
library(zoo)

# Create some sample data with a few artefacts
set.seed(123)
rr_data <- tibble(time = cumsum(rnorm(100, mean = 0.8, sd = 0.1)))
rr_data$time[50] <- rr_data$time[50] + 1.0 # Missed beat
rr_data$time[70] <- rr_data$time[70] - 0.4 # Extra beat

# Detect and classify the artefacts
rr_data_classified <- classify_hrv_artefacts_lipponen(rr_data)

# Print the rows with artefacts
print(rr_data_classified \%>\% filter(classification != "normal"))
