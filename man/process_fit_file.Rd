\arguments{
\item{file_path}{Path to FIT file}

\item{standing_time}{Time in seconds to consider as standing}

\item{transition_time}{Time in seconds to consider as transition}

\item{laying_time}{Time in seconds to consider as laying}

\item{min_rr}{Minimum RR interval in milliseconds}

\item{max_rr}{Maximum RR interval in milliseconds}

\item{window_size}{Window size for moving average calculation}

\item{threshold}{Threshold for artifact detection}

\item{centered_transition}{Logical indicating whether the transition time
should be split into laying and standing times. FALSE, if transition time
is only taken from the laying phase.}

\item{centered_window}{Logical indicating whether the moving window should
be centered. Defaults to FALSE.}

\item{warmup}{Time in seconds from the start that should be discarded}

\item{sport_name}{Name of the sport for the fit file. Used as a filter.}

\item{min_quality_threshold}{Minimum quality threshold (0-1) for data to be processed.
Data below this quality threshold will be discarded. Default is 0.0 (no filtering).}

\item{correction_method}{Character string specifying the artifact correction
method. Options are: "linear", "cubic", "lipponen", "none". Default is "linear".}
