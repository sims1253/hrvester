\title{Calculate full neural recovery score based on BioForce HRV methodology}
\usage{
calculate_neural_recovery(data, window_size = 7)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{Dataframe containing HRV measurements. Should include:
\itemize{
\item laying_rmssd (numeric): RMSSD during laying position
\item laying_resting_hr (numeric): Resting heart rate
\item rmssd_ma (numeric): Moving average of RMSSD (added by
calculate_moving_averages)
\item standing_hr (numeric): Heart rate during standing position
\item hrr_60s (numeric): Heart rate recovery after 60 seconds
}}

\item{window_size}{Number of days to use for calculating moving averages
(default: 7). Used to establish baseline values for comparison.
Must be a positive integer.}
}
\value{
Dataframe with added columns:
\itemize{
\item rmssd_score (numeric): Score based on RMSSD ratio (0-40 points)
\item ortho_score (numeric): Score based on orthostatic response (0-30 points)
\item hrr_score (numeric): Score based on heart rate recovery (0-30 points)
\item neural_recovery_score (numeric): Combined total score (0-100)
\item recovery_status (character): Classification based on total score
}
}
\description{
This function calculates a comprehensive neural recovery score by combining
multiple HRV metrics. The score is based on the following components:
\itemize{
\item RMSSD (parasympathetic recovery)
\item Orthostatic response (autonomic balance)
\item Heart rate recovery (recovery capacity)
}
}
