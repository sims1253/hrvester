\title{Detect RR Interval Artifacts Using Kubios-Style Adaptive Thresholds}
\usage{
detect_artifacts_kubios(
  rr_intervals,
  threshold_level = "medium",
  hr_adaptive = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rr_intervals}{Numeric vector of RR intervals in milliseconds}

\item{threshold_level}{Character string specifying threshold level:
"low" (0.35s), "medium" (0.25s), or "strong" (0.15s). Default is "medium"}

\item{hr_adaptive}{Logical indicating whether to use HR-adaptive thresholds.
Default is TRUE}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{artifact_indices}: Integer vector of detected artifact positions
\item \code{artifact_mask}: Logical vector indicating artifacts
\item \code{threshold_used}: Numeric threshold value used for detection
\item \code{drr_series}: Difference RR series used for analysis
}
}
\description{
Implements research-validated artifact detection using Kubios-style
time-varying thresholds with dRR series analysis. This method differentiates
ectopic beats from normal sinus rhythm using adaptive thresholding.
}
\details{
This function implements the Kubios-style artifact detection algorithm:
\enumerate{
\item Calculates dRR (difference RR) series for adaptive analysis
\item Applies time-varying thresholds based on local HRV levels
\item Uses medium threshold (0.25s) as optimal for most populations
\item Differentiates ectopic beats from normal sinus rhythm
\item Adapts thresholds based on HR when hr_adaptive = TRUE
}

The method follows research recommendations from Kubios HRV 2023-2024
updates for automatic beat correction using research-validated thresholds.
