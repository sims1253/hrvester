\title{Correct RR Intervals Using Cubic Spline Interpolation}
\usage{
correct_rr_cubic_spline(
  rr_intervals,
  threshold_percent = 25,
  hr_adaptive = TRUE,
  max_correction_rate = 5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{rr_intervals}{Numeric vector of RR intervals in milliseconds}

\item{threshold_percent}{Percentage threshold for artifact detection.
Default is 25\% following Kubios methodology}

\item{hr_adaptive}{Logical indicating whether to use HR-adaptive thresholds.
Default is TRUE}

\item{max_correction_rate}{Maximum percentage of beats that can be corrected.
Default is 5\% to avoid over-smoothing}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{corrected_rr}: Numeric vector of corrected RR intervals
\item \code{artifact_mask}: Logical vector indicating which beats were corrected
\item \code{n_corrected}: Number of intervals that were corrected
}
}
\description{
Applies cubic spline interpolation to detect and correct artifacts in RR
intervals. This method follows the Kubios methodology and balances
automation with accuracy.
}
\details{
This function implements the Kubios-style cubic spline correction:
\itemize{
\item Uses HR-adaptive thresholds (20-30\% or 0.20-0.30s ranges)
\item Limits corrections to <5\% of beats to avoid over-smoothing
\item Applies cubic spline interpolation using R's spline() function
\item Automatically detects artifacts based on percentage deviation
}

The method balances automated detection with preservation of physiological
variability, making it widely adopted in HRV research.
