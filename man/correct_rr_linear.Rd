\title{Correct RR Intervals Using Linear Interpolation}
\usage{
correct_rr_linear(rr_intervals, artifact_indices, preserve_boundaries = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{rr_intervals}{Numeric vector of RR intervals in milliseconds}

\item{artifact_indices}{Integer vector of indices identifying artifacts}

\item{preserve_boundaries}{Logical indicating whether to preserve segment
boundaries to avoid "flattening" effects. Default is TRUE}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of corrected RR intervals with same length as input
}
\description{
Applies linear interpolation to correct identified artifacts in RR intervals.
This method provides the lowest RMSSD bias according to research and is
particularly effective for single-beat artifacts.
}
\details{
This function implements enhanced linear interpolation following research
recommendations:
\itemize{
\item Uses the 20\% rule for artifact detection when artifact_indices not provided
\item Handles single beats differently from longer gaps (>3 beats)
\item Preserves segment boundaries to maintain physiological variability
\item For edge artifacts, uses nearest valid value rather than extrapolation
}

Linear interpolation has been shown to produce the lowest RMSSD bias
among correction methods, making it ideal for HRV analysis.

\examples{
\dontrun{
rr_data <- c(800, 850, 400, 830, 810)  # 400 is an artifact
corrected <- correct_rr_linear(rr_data, artifact_indices = 3)
}
