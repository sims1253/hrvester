\arguments{
\item{dir_path}{The directory path containing FIT files to process.}

\item{cache_file}{Path to the cache file for storing processed data. Defaults to "hrv_cache.csv" within the directory.}

\item{standing_time}{Time in seconds to consider as standing. Default is 180 seconds.}

\item{transition_time}{Time in seconds to consider as transition. Default is 20 seconds.}

\item{laying_time}{Time in seconds to consider as laying. Default is 180 seconds.}

\item{min_rr}{Minimum RR interval in milliseconds. Default is 272 ms.}

\item{max_rr}{Maximum RR interval in milliseconds. Default is 2000 ms.}

\item{window_size}{Window size for moving average calculation. Default is 7.}

\item{threshold}{Threshold for artifact detection. Default is 0.2.}

\item{centered_transition}{Logical indicating whether to center transition phases. Default is TRUE.}

\item{centered_window}{Logical indicating whether to use centered window for processing. Default is FALSE.}

\item{warmup}{Warmup time in seconds to exclude from beginning. Default is 70.}

\item{clear_cache}{Logical indicating whether to clear existing cache. Default is FALSE.}

\item{sport_name}{Character string specifying the sport name filter. Default is "OST".}

\item{min_quality_threshold}{Minimum quality threshold (0-1) for data to be processed.
Data below this quality threshold will be discarded. Default is 0.0 (no filtering).}

\item{correction_method}{Character string specifying the artifact correction
method. Options are: "linear", "cubic", "lipponen", "none". Default is "linear".}
}
\value{
A tibble containing HRV metrics for all processed FIT files
}
\description{
Processes multiple FIT files from a specified directory, utilizing caching to
avoid reprocessing unchanged files. This function efficiently processes new or updated files in a directory, leveraging a cache to skip already processed files.
