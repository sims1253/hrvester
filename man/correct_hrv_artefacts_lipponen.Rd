\usage{
correct_hrv_artefacts_lipponen(data)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A \code{dplyr::tibble} returned by
\code{detect_hrv_artefacts}, containing 'time' and 'classification' columns.}
}
\value{
A \code{dplyr::tibble} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{time}: The \emph{corrected} RR intervals (in milliseconds).
\item \code{classification}:  The updated classification column. Intervals that
were corrected by interpolation will have the classification
\code{"interpolated"}. Inserted "missed" beats will have the classification
\code{"missed"}. Removed beats will not be present.
}
}
\description{
This function takes the output of \code{detect_hrv_artefacts} (a tibble with RR
intervals and artefact classifications) and performs the actual artefact
correction, including:
}
\details{
\itemize{
\item \strong{Interpolation:} Ectopic, long, and short beats are corrected by
replacing the identified intervals with values obtained via cubic spline
interpolation.
\item \strong{Removal:} Extra beats are removed.
\item \strong{Insertion:}  Rows are inserted for missed beats, with the time
value set to half the duration of the long interval.
