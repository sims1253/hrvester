\title{Extract RR intervals from FIT file}
\usage{
extract_rr_data(
  fit_object,
  filter_factor = 0.15,
  laying_time = 180,
  standing_time = 180,
  transition_buffer = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit_object}{FITfileR object containing the FIT file data}

\item{filter_factor}{Numeric value (0-1) for filtering outliers. Higher values
allow more variation between successive intervals}

\item{laying_time}{Duration in seconds for laying position (default: 180)}

\item{standing_time}{Duration in seconds for standing position (default: 180)}

\item{transition_buffer}{Time in seconds to exclude around position change (default: 5)}
}
\value{
List containing:
\item{laying}{Numeric vector of RR intervals during laying position (seconds)}
\item{standing}{Numeric vector of RR intervals during standing position (seconds)}
}
\description{
Extracts heart rate variability data from FIT files by analyzing RR intervals
during both laying and standing positions. Implements robust filtering to maintain
data quality and properly handle phase transitions.
