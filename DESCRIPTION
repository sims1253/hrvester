Description: An R package for analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data from .fit
  files, with a focus on orthostatic tests. Provides tools for RR interval
  preprocessing (artifact detection, physiological plausibility checks, moving
  average filtering), calculation of key HRV metrics (RMSSD, SDNN, resting HR,
  heart rate recovery), computation of a neural recovery score, and generation of
  training recommendations. Includes features for handling multiple files, caching
  results, and producing summary reports. Offers specialized analysis for
  Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and strength training.
