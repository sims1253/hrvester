Description: An R package for analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV) data from .fit
  files, with a focus on orthostatic tests. Features research-validated 
  preprocessing with Kubios-style artifact detection, multiple correction methods
  (linear interpolation, cubic spline, Lipponen-Tarvainen), and comprehensive
  quality assessment following clinical HRV standards. Provides tools for RR 
  interval preprocessing, calculation of key HRV metrics (RMSSD, SDNN, resting HR,
  heart rate recovery), computation of a neural recovery score, and generation of
  training recommendations. Includes features for handling multiple files, caching
  results with quality metrics, and producing summary reports.
