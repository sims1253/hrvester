## What is HRV?

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) is the variation in time intervals between heartbeats.
It's a non-invasive measure that reflects the activity of your autonomic nervous
system, and it can be used to assess your body's readiness for training,
recovery status, and overall stress levels.

## What is hrvester?

`hrvester` is an R package designed for analyzing Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
data from `.fit` files generated by Garmin devices (and potentially others).
It focuses on orthostatic tests (measuring HRV while laying down and then
standing up) to provide insights into an athlete's recovery and readiness for
training.

The package implements research-validated preprocessing methods including:
- **Kubios-style artifact detection** with time-varying thresholds
- **Multiple correction methods**: Linear interpolation, cubic spline, and Lipponen-Tarvainen algorithms
- **Comprehensive quality assessment** following clinical HRV standards
- **Automated orthostatic test analysis** with phase-specific processing

## Features

- **Research-Grade Preprocessing Pipeline:** Implements state-of-the-art artifact correction methods validated in peer-reviewed literature
  - **Kubios-style Detection:** Time-varying thresholds with dRR series analysis for robust artifact identification
  - **Multiple Correction Methods:** Linear interpolation (lowest RMSSD bias), cubic spline (Kubios-compatible), and Lipponen-Tarvainen (< 2% error)
  - **Quality Assessment:** Clinical-grade quality metrics with A/B/C/D/F grading system
  
- **Orthostatic Test Processing:** Full pipeline from raw `.fit` files to readiness scores, including:
  - **RR Interval Preprocessing:** Robust artifact detection, physiological plausibility checks, and research-validated correction methods
  - **HRV Metric Calculation:** Calculates key HRV metrics like RMSSD and SDNN with quality-assured data
  - **Resting Heart Rate Estimation:** Uses a robust algorithm to determine resting heart rate
  - **Neural Recovery Score:** Proprietary algorithm for athlete readiness assessment
  - **Trend Analysis:** Moving averages and trend detection for long-term monitoring

- **Data Management:** 
  - **Intelligent Caching:** Automatic caching system with quality metrics storage to avoid reprocessing
  - **Quality Filtering:** Configurable quality thresholds to automatically exclude poor measurements
  - **Batch Processing:** Process entire directories of `.fit` files efficiently
  
- **Visualization & Reporting:**
  - **Interactive Dashboards:** Comprehensive HRV trend visualization with ggplot2
  - **Training Recommendations:** Data-driven insights based on HRV trends and readiness scores
  - **Export Capabilities:** Multiple output formats for integration with other tools

## Installation

You can install the development version of hrvester from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("sims1253/hrvester")
```

## Quick Start

Here's a basic example showing how to process a single HRV orthostatic test:

```r
library(hrvester)

# Process a single FIT file with research-validated preprocessing
result <- process_fit_file("your_file.fit", 
                          correction_method = "linear",
                          min_quality_threshold = 0.7)

# View the results
result
```

## Preprocessing Methods

The package offers multiple research-validated artifact correction methods:

```r
# Read a FIT file
fit_data <- FITfileR::readFitFile("your_file.fit")

# Extract RR intervals with different correction methods
rr_linear <- extract_rr_data(fit_data, correction_method = "linear")
rr_cubic <- extract_rr_data(fit_data, correction_method = "cubic") 
rr_lipponen <- extract_rr_data(fit_data, correction_method = "lipponen")
rr_none <- extract_rr_data(fit_data, correction_method = "none")

# Compare quality metrics
methods <- list("Linear" = rr_linear, "Cubic" = rr_cubic, 
                "Lipponen" = rr_lipponen, "None" = rr_none)

sapply(methods, function(x) attr(x, "quality_metrics")$quality_grade)
```

## Batch Processing

Process multiple files efficiently with automatic quality filtering:

```r
# Process an entire directory of FIT files
results <- process_fit_directory("fit_files/", 
                                min_quality_threshold = 0.7,
                                correction_method = "linear")

# View summary statistics
summary(results)

# Show quality distribution
table(results$laying_quality_grade)
```


## Advanced Usage

### Custom Quality Assessment

```r
# Extract RR data and assess quality manually
rr_data <- extract_rr_data(fit_data, correction_method = "linear")
quality_metrics <- attr(rr_data, "quality_metrics")

# Check quality details
quality_metrics[c("artifact_percentage", "signal_quality_index", "quality_grade")]

# Check if measurement meets research standards
if(quality_metrics$signal_quality_index >= 90 && 
   quality_metrics$artifact_percentage < 5) {
  print("Research-grade measurement")
} else {
  print("Consider re-measurement")
}
```

### Readiness Analysis

```r
# Analyze readiness - get current and baseline data
current_metrics <- tail(results, 1)  # Most recent measurement
baseline_metrics <- head(tail(results, 8), 7)  # Previous 7 days

# Analyze readiness status
readiness <- analyze_readiness(current_metrics, baseline_metrics)

# View training recommendations
cat("Training status:", readiness$status)
readiness$recommendations
```

## Research Validation

The preprocessing pipeline implements methods validated in peer-reviewed literature:

- **Linear Interpolation**: Consistently shows lowest RMSSD bias (Giles et al., 2018)
- **Cubic Spline**: Kubios-compatible method balancing automation with accuracy (Singh et al., 2020)  
- **Lipponen-Tarvainen**: State-of-the-art algorithm achieving <2% HRV error (Lipponen & Tarvainen, 2019)
